# Paradox-Modpack-Helper
Multitool for creating modpacks to be used with the [installation tool](https://github.com/RagingFlames/Fire-Mod-Updater). Has several options to help with creating a modpack. Can bulk rename workshop ID folders to be the name of the mod. Can also guide the user through making a modpack automatically by basing a modpack off an existing stellaris playset while preserving load order.

# Building
Install all the prerequisits and then install [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). Run `build.bat` to build the script into a standalone executable.
